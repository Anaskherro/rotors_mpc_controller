# rotors_mpc_controller

A ROS package that provides a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for quadrotor trajectory tracking in Gazebo. The controller uses [acados](https://github.com/acados/acados) for fast optimal control, and interfaces with the [RotorS simulator](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator) (included as a git submodule).

The package targets ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04 and has been tested against the RotorS "hummingbird" configuration. The NMPC now drives the four rotor thrusts directly, so no auxiliary mixer is required.

## Features

- Rotor-level NMPC solved with acados and CasADi using a 13-state quadrotor model.
- Direct mapping from solver outputs to rotor speeds with saturation handling.
- Warm-start caching with fail-safe reuse of the last valid command.
- Periodic logging of the internal NMPC state, references, and final thrust commands.
- Configurable parameters via YAML for solver weights, vehicle properties, and thrust limits.
- Live tuning through `dynamic_reconfigure` (`rqt_reconfigure`) with automatic acados solver regeneration whenever solver parameters change.
- Minimum-snap trajectory generator (continuous or approach/stop profiles) inspired by data_driven_mpc, including feed-forward thrust and yaw references.
- RViz visualisation of the flown path via a lightweight path publisher node and bundled display configuration.
- Gazebo launch integration that spawns the RotorS hummingbird and the NMPC node.

## Prerequisites

- **ROS Noetic** (tested on Ubuntu 20.04). Make sure your workspace is initialized: `source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash`.
- **acados** built with Python bindings. Follow the official [acados installation guide](https://docs.acados.org/installation/index.html). Ensure that `ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` refer to your acados build, and that `acados_template` is on `PYTHONPATH`.
- **CasADi** ≥ 3.6.6 is recommended by acados. Noetic ships 3.5.1 by default; consider installing a newer wheel in a virtual environment if you need the speed-ups.
- Python dependencies: the nodes rely only on the ROS Noetic Python stack and NumPy (already a ROS dependency).

## Clone and build

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
# Clone this repository and pull submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/anaskherro/rotors_mpc_controller.git
cd rotors_mpc_controller
# If you cloned without --recurse-submodules, run:
#   git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install RotorS dependencies (from their README)
rosdep install --from-paths third_party/rotors_simulator --ignore-src -r -y

cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build rotors_mpc_controller
source devel/setup.bash
```

> **Note**: The first time you run the NMPC node, acados will generate solver code in `~/.cache/rotors_mpc_controller/acados`. Subsequent parameter changes made via `rqt_reconfigure` or YAML edits automatically rebuild the solver; you no longer need to delete the cache manually.

## Running the simulator

```bash
roslaunch rotors_mpc_controller hummingbird_mpc.launch
```

This launch file will:

1. Start Gazebo with the RotorS world.
2. Spawn the hummingbird vehicle.
3. Launch `mpc_controller_node`, which now maps solver thrusts directly to motor speeds.
4. Start RViz with the bundled configuration (`config/rotors_mpc.rviz`) and a `path_publisher_node` that traces the actual vehicle path on `/path`.

You can command a new setpoint by publishing a `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped` to `/mpc_controller/setpoint`. Example:

```bash
rostopic pub /mpc_controller/setpoint geometry_msgs/PoseStamped "header: {frame_id: world}
pose: {position: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.5}, orientation: {w: 1.0}}" -1
```

## Configuration

All runtime parameters live in [`config/params.yaml`](config/params.yaml). Key sections:

- `solver`: NMPC horizon, discretization, quadratic weights, and regularisation.
- `vehicle`: mass, inertia, arm length, rotor constants, motor speed limits.
- `controller`: rotor thrust limits.
- `reference`: default hold position/velocity/yaw plus optional trajectory staging.
- `topics`: ROS topic names for state, motor speeds, and setpoint input.
- `node`: execution rate and logging interval.

Shipped defaults (also pre-populated in `rqt_reconfigure`) now match the tuned rotor-level setup:

- `horizon_steps = 20`, `dt = 0.05 s`, `iter_max = 600`, `regularization = 7e-3`.
- Position weights `[10, 10, 8]`, velocity weights `[1, 1, 0.2]`, quaternion weights `[3.2 × 4]`, rate weights `[1.4, 1.4, 0.4]`.
- Control penalty `1.75` per rotor and terminal weights `[5, 5, 3, 2, 2, 2, 12, 12, 12, 18.5, 2, 2, 1.8]`.
- Thrust window `[0, 20]` N per motor; the default reference holds the vehicle at `(0, 0, 2.5)` with zero velocity.
- Trajectory defaults: 1 m radius, 1 m altitude circular path centred at `(1, 1)` and sampled at 50 Hz. Adjust `start_position_tolerance` to control how close the preparation stage must get before you start tracking.

`reference.trajectory` accepts two execution profiles:

- `profile: stop` (default on old deployments) accelerates, coasts, then brakes back to a hover. Use `revolutions` to decide how many loops should be generated, and set `loop: true` if you want the controller to repeat the precomputed path.
- `profile: continuous` keeps the vehicle at constant speed and returns to the first point with matched velocity, producing seamless laps when `loop: true`. `revolutions` still controls how many samples are generated in the buffer.

Additional knobs: `clockwise` chooses rotation direction, `center` offsets the circle, `yaw_mode` selects between tangent-following and fixed yaw, and `yaw_constant`/`yaw_offset` fine-tune the desired heading.

Changes take effect immediately when adjusted through `rqt_reconfigure`. For YAML edits, the node rebuilds the solver during startup using the updated values.

## Live tuning with dynamic reconfigure

The controller exposes all solver, vehicle, controller, reference, and topic settings through ROS dynamic reconfigure. To adjust parameters on the fly:

```bash
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
```

Select the `rotors_mpc_controller` namespace and tweak the sliders. Solver-related changes regenerate the acados model instantly, while other entries update the running controller without a restart. The `solver_horizon_steps` and `solver_iter_max` sliders now span up to 600 to simplify large-horizon experiments.

## Logging and debugging

Every `node.log_interval` seconds (default 3 s) the MPC node prints:

```
MPC log: status=<acados_status> pos=<current> vel=<current_vel> quat=<current_quat>
         ref_pos=<ref_position> ref_vel=<ref_velocity> ref_quat=<ref_quaternion>
         ref_thrust=<reference_thrust> cmd=<clipped_thrust>
```

Use this to diagnose divergence, saturation, or solver failures. If acados returns a non-zero status, the node reuses the last valid command and logs the snapshot so you can inspect what happened.

## Staged trajectory workflow

The controller can preload a full trajectory (e.g. a circular path) and follow it on command. Two private services manage the stages:

- `rosservice call /mpc_controller_node/prepare_trajectory "data: true"` moves the vehicle to the trajectory’s starting waypoint and holds position.
- `rosservice call /mpc_controller_node/start_trajectory "data: true"` begins MPC tracking of the stored path. Call either service with `data: false` to abort and return to hover.

Example session:

```bash
roslaunch rotors_mpc_controller hummingbird_mpc.launch
rosservice call /mpc_controller_node/prepare_trajectory "data: true"
rosservice call /mpc_controller_node/start_trajectory "data: true"
# ... later ...
rosservice call /mpc_controller_node/start_trajectory "data: false"
```

Trajectory parameters (radius, altitude, speed, profile, revolutions, loop behaviour, `start_position_tolerance`, etc.) live under `reference.trajectory` in `config/params.yaml`. A helper publisher at `src/test/waypoints.py` can stream circular setpoints if you prefer topic-based control instead of the built-in trajectory buffer.

## Visualising the path

When you launch `hummingbird_mpc.launch`, RViz starts automatically with the layout stored in [`config/rotors_mpc.rviz`](config/rotors_mpc.rviz). The included `path_publisher_node` subscribes to `/hummingbird/ground_truth/odometry` and publishes an accumulating `nav_msgs/Path` on `/path`, making it easy to compare the actual trajectory against the MPC reference.

## Adding as a dependency

To use the controller in another catkin workspace:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git submodule add https://github.com/anaskherro/rotors_mpc_controller.git rotors_mpc_controller
cd rotors_mpc_controller
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then follow the build steps above.
